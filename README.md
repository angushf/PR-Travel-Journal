# Travel Journal

### Keep track of your travel dates

---


**What will the application do?**

- The travel journal application will allow people to record their trips outside Canada or any other country.  
It will be designed in such a way so that individuals will be able to keep track of their travel dates, destinations, and reason for travel. 

**Who will use it?**

- Permanent Residents in Canada. This information is of paramount importance when it comes to applying for a new Permanent Residence card or for Canadian Citizenship, as it is often required to provide a detailed travel history on said application.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

- This project is of interest to me because I am a Permanent Resident myself and have
gone through the PR renewal application process many times. Although this is something I only have to
do about every 4-5 years, it is a huge time sink and pain to scrape together a detailed, chronological 
travel history for the last 4-5 years. Not only will this project help me the next time I have
to fill out the PR renewal application, hopefully it will also help others in the same position!
